# Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout
A set of tools for graph layout and viewing

The simplest way to start with MSAGL in C# is to open GraphLayout.sln in Visual Studio 2013, and have a look at Samples there.

MSAGL is a .NET tool for graph layout and viewing. It was developed in Microsoft by Lev Nachmanson, Sergey Pupyrev, Tim Dwyer and Ted Hart. MSAGL is available as open source at https://github.com/Microsoft/automatic-graph-layout.git.

## The Distribution Content and Important Features
The package contains the following:

* Layout engine (Microsoft.MSAGL.dll) - The core layout functionality. This component can be used directly in cases when visualization is handled by a tool other than MSAGL.
* Drawing module (Microsoft.MSAGL.Drawing.dll) - The Definitions of different drawing attributes like colors, line styles, etc. It also contains definitions of a node class, an edge class, and a graph class. By using these classes a user can create a graph object and use it later for layout, and rendering.
* Viewer control (Microsoft.MSAGL.GraphViewerGDIGraph.dll) - The viewer control, and  some other rendering functionality.

Some important features of the viewer are:

* Pan and Zoom of the graph.
* Forward and Backward navigation.
* Ability to configure tooltips and highlighting of graph entities.
* Ability to search for and focus on entities of the graph.

#Code Samples
The code snippet demonstrates the basic usage of the viewer. It uses the C# language.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic; 
using System.Windows.Forms; 
class ViewerSample { 
    public static void Main() { 
    //create a form 
        System.Windows.Forms.Form form = new System.Windows.Forms.Form(); 
    //create a viewer object 
        Microsoft.Msagl.GraphViewerGdi.GViewer viewer = new Microsoft.Msagl.GraphViewerGdi.GViewer(); 
    //create a graph object 
        Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Graph graph = new Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Graph("graph"); 
    //create the graph content 
        graph.AddEdge("A", "B");
        graph.AddEdge("B", "C"); 
        graph.AddEdge("A", "C").EdgeAttr.Color = Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Color.Green; 
        graph.FindNode("A").Attr.Fillcolor = Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Color.Magenta; 
        graph.FindNode("B").Attr.Fillcolor = Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Color.MistyRose; 
        Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Node c = graph.FindNode("C");  
        c.Attr.Fillcolor = Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Color.PaleGreen;
        c.Attr.Shape = Microsoft.Msagl.Drawing.Shape.Diamond; 
    //bind the graph to the viewer 
        viewer.Graph = graph; 
    //associate the viewer with the form 
        form.SuspendLayout(); 
        viewer.Dock = System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill; 
        form.Controls.Add(viewer); 
        form.ResumeLayout(); 
    //show the form 
        form.ShowDialog(); 
    } 
}
```
